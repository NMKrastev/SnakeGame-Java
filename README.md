# SnakeGame-Java
After lots of tutorials that I watched and learned from, I've decided to create a "Snake like game" using Java. Of course, I used Stackoverflow(and similar), YouTube, etc. to help me create this simple application.</br>
The project has been converted to Maven project due to easier work with Jenkins.</br>
I have a working pom.xml file that compiles, tests and installs the project using Jenkins. The only thing that I still don't fully understand is how to deploy it.</br>
